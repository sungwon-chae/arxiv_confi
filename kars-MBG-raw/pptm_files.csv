Sentiments for public and EV communities are vary.

Non-sense of Farasis on the EQE. Why deceive the customers. Pay back immediately!! Will you take the responsibility for the fire if happened? 

To make sure MB didn’t deceive (the battery) or admit the fault. Due to the massive discount (on NC), it is difficult to dispose. And now the owners are in trouble due to the awkward battery. MB is no more respected brand.

Please solve the lie on battery.
